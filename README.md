# graphiti-color-theme README

A custom VSCode color theme meant to emphasize the difference between stored variables, literals, 'verby/actiony' keywords for functions, and language keywords. Developed with modern web development (HTML, CSS, JS) in mind. 

All settings relevant to the theme are in themes\Graphiti-color-theme.json. Please enjoy!
