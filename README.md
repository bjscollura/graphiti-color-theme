# graphiti-color-theme README

A custom VSCode color theme meant to emphasize the difference between stored variables, literals, 'verby/actiony' keywords for functions, and language keywords. Developed with modern web development (HTML, CSS, JS) in mind. 

To install in VSCode, download this project and save the downloaded (and unzipped) directory into your ~/.vscode/extensions/ directory (this should be a hidden folder in your home directory by default), or create a new folder there and save the 'themes' folder from this project into it, including the json file within.

Please enjoy!
